# Maintaining Heading
			1. Locate Red and Green Buoys
			# Here the boat will identify the red buoy and check that it is to the left of the boat
			# Here the boat will identify the green buoy and check that it is to the right of the boat
			# Here it will update the map and know where the buoys are in space
			2. Align with buoys (square up)
			3. Move Forward
			4. Check yaw (make sure it is unchanged)
			# Here the boat will drop a way point in the center of the buoy and travel towards the waypoint
			# Here the boat will start the process over by looking for the next set of buoys
			5. Check red and green orientation
			6. Move forward (yaw unchanged)
			

			# Circumnavigation
			# If travelling in the clockwise direction, it is important that the boat stay oriented to the left of the buoys. 
			# (and vice versa if traveling counterclockwise).
			1. Locate four buoys
			# Here the boat will search the area for at least two of the four buoys.
			2. Position base on left of buoys
			# Once at least two are found the boat will orient itself so that the buoys are on its right side.
			# Now it will store the starting position of itself
			3. Circle buoy clockwise 90o
			# First the boat will drop a way point to the left and a little past the buoy 
			# Now it will travel to that waypoint and check it has gone past the buoy far enough.
			# Now it will spin 90 degrees clockwise 
			4. (Repeat 3x)
			# Then it will repeat the process until it has gotten to the starting position of the task
			5. Exit

			# Slalom Maneuver
			1. Locate buoys
			# Here the boat will scan the area for bouys (probably a line of buoys)
			2. Align buoys so all are in center
			3. Check for red 
			# Here the boat will look for the first red buoy 
			# Here the boat will find were it is relative to the red buoy
			4. Start to circle from right
			# Here the boat will drop a way point to the right of the red buoy
			# Here the boat will travel to the waypoint
			# Now the boat will scan for the next green buoy and update its map
			5. Check red and green orientation (red left / green right)
			# Here the boat will drop a waypoint between the previous red and current green buoys
			6. Move through and around the left
			# Here the boat will add a waypoint to the left of the green buoy
			# Now it will travel to the waypoint
			7. Repeat until finding can buoy
			# the boat will repeat the scan for the next red buoy and travel around the right 
			# Once it gets to the last (fourth) buoy, it scans for the circle can buoy
			# It identifies the circle can buoy
			8. Circle can buoy
			# Set a waypoint on the backside of the circle can
			# travel to next waypoint
			9. Check red and green orientation 
			# if the buoy is green (which it should be at this point) place a waypoint to the left of the buoy
			# move to way point
			# Scan for red buoy
			# Place waypoint to right of buoy
			# move to way point
			10. Finish slalom
			11. Exit course
			

			# Autonomous Navigation
			1. Locate Red and Green Buoys
			# Here the boat will identify the red buoy and check that it is to the left of the boat
			# Here the boat will identify the green buoy and check that it is to the right of the boat
			# Here it will update the map and know where the buoys are in space
			2. Align with buoys (square up)
			3. Move Forward
			4. Check yaw (make sure it is unchanged)
			# Here the boat will drop a way point in the center of the buoy and travel towards the waypoint
			# Here the boat will start the process over by looking for the next set of buoys
			5. Check red and green orientation
			6. Move forward (yaw unchanged)
			

			# Find the Path
			1. Circle environment and map out the buoys
			# Here the boat will locate the central can buoy using the lidar and camera
			# Once the can buoy is located and identified the boat will scan the perimeter of the challenge and save a map of the course
			2. Find a good path toward the center of the environment
			# When the perimeter scan is finished, the boat will drop a waypoint in the center of the mess of buoys
			3. get to the center without touching any other buoys
			# The boat travels to the waypoint in the mess of buoys while avoiding obstacles
			4. Once in the center find the central can buoy
			# Locate can buoy using laser and camera
			# Update map with central can location
			5. Locate and circle around the can buoy
			6. Exit out of the environment
			# Follow entrance path to exit the mess of buoys
			7. Exit course
			

			# Docking
			1. Enter gate buoys
			# Here the boat will go to the designated GPS coordinate for the docking challenge. 
			2. Locate dock 
			# Here the boat will scan for the dock and recognize it as such
			3. Move X distance from dock
			# Here the boat will follow the line perpendicular to the midpoint of the dock 
			4. Orent perpendicular to dock
			# Here the boat will orient 
			5. Find edge of dock
			6. Travel parallel to edge of dock plus X distance further
			7. Turn around (yaw)
			8. Deploy hydrophones (if not already done)
			9. Full speed forward for X seconds
			10. Kill thrusters
			11. Active hydrophones
			12. Listen and map out strongest signal distance
			13. Raise hydrophones
			14. Orient perpendicular to dock
			15. Move to calculated docking (sway)
			16. Locate Symbol
			17. Align Straight with symbol
			18. Pause for X seconds
			19. Reverse out of dock
			20. Exit course
