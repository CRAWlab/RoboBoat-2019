# Docking
# Enter gate buoys
# Locate dock 
# Move X distance from dock
# Orent perpendicular to dock
# Find edge of dock
# Travel parallel to edge of dock plus X distance further
# Turn around (yaw)
# Deploy hydrophones (if not already done)
# Full speed forward for X seconds
# Kill thrusters
# Active hydrophones
# Listen and map out strongest signal distance
# Raise hydrophones
# Orient perpendicular to dock
# Move to calculated docking (sway)
# Locate Symbol
# Align Straight with symbol
# Pause for X seconds
# Reverse out of dock
# Exit course

# Maintaining Heading
# Locate Red and Green Buoys
# Align with buoys (square up)
# Move Forward
# Check yaw (make sure it is unchanged)
# Check red and green orientation
# Move forward (yaw unchanged)

# Circumnavigation
# Locate four buoys
# Position base on left of buoys
# Circle buoy clockwise 90o
# (Repeat 3x)
# Exit

# OR

# Locate four buoys
# Position base on left of buoys
# Circle buoy clockwise 135o
# (Repeat 3x)
# Exit

#
# Slalom Maneuver
# Locate buoys
# Align buoys so all are in center
# Check for red 
# Start to circle from right
# Check red and green orientation (red left / green right)
# Move through and around the left
# Repeat until finding can buoy
# Circle can buoy
# Check red and green orientation (red left / green right)
# Move through and around the left
# Finish slalom
# Exit course

# Autonomous Navigation
# Locate red and green buoys
# Check orientation (red left / green right)
# Move through buoys
# Repeat

# Find the Path
# Circle environment and map out the buoys
# Find a good path toward the center of the environment
# get to the center without touching any other buoys
# Once in the center find the centeral can buoy
# Locate and circle around the can buoy
# Exit out of the environment
# Exit course
