# Maintaining Heading
	1. Locate Red and Green Buoys
# Here the boat will identify the red buoy and check that it is to the left of the boat
# Here the boat will identify the green buoy and check that it is to the right of the boat
# Here it will update the map and know where the buoys are in space
	2. Align with buoys (square up)
	3. Move Forward
	4. Check yaw (make sure it is unchanged)
# Here the boat will drop a way point in the center of the buoy and travel towards the waypoint
# Here the boat will start the process over by looking for the next set of buoys
	5. Check red and green orientation
	6. Move forward (yaw unchanged)
			
# Circumnavigation
# If travelling in the clockwise direction, it is important that the boat stay oriented to the left of the buoys. 
# (and vice versa if traveling counterclockwise).
	1. Locate four buoys
# Here the boat will scan the area for the four buoys.
# Here the boat will use object recognition to identify the buoys
# The boat will update its maps and begin localization.
	2. Position base on left of buoys
# Orient itself so that the buoys are on its right side.
# Now it will store the starting position of itself next to the first buoy
	3. Circle buoy clockwise 90o
# First the boat will drop a way point to the left and a little past the next buoy 
# Now it will travel to that waypoint 
# Now it will spin 90 degrees clockwise 
	4. (Repeat 3x)
# Then it will repeat the process until it has gotten to the starting position of the task
	5. Exit

# Slalom Maneuver
	1. Locate buoys
# Here the boat will scan the area for bouys (probably a line of buoys)
# The boat will scan and build the map for the course
# The boat will identify all red (2), green (2), and circle can (1) buoys in the course
	2. Travel to the beginning of the course
# Set a waypoint at the end of the task course
# Travel to the waypoint and finish pose facing the first bouy
	3.  Set a path for the course
# Here the boat will set waypoints for the course 
# Red buoys will receive a waypoint on the right with a orientation of 135 degrees from horizontal X axis
# Green buoys will receive a waypoint on the left with a orientation of 45 degrees from horizontal X axis
# An additional waypoint will be dropped at the midpoints of each bouy
# The boat will travel to each waypoint starting on the right, moving to the midpoint, to the left, and then moving to the midpoint again.
	7. Repeat until finding can buoy 
# Once it gets to the last (fourth) buoy, it scans for the circle can buoy
# It identifies the circle can buoy
	8. Circle can buoy
# Set a waypoint on the right, backside, and left of the circle can
# travel to waypoints with last orientation at 270 degrees from the horizontal X axis
	9. Check red and green orientation 
# Here the boat will set waypoints for the course 
# Red buoys will receive a waypoint on the right with a orientation of 315 degrees from horizontal X axis
# Green buoys will receive a waypoint on the left with a orientation of 225 degrees from horizontal X axis
# An additional waypoint will be dropped at the midpoints of each bouy
# The boat will travel to each waypoint starting on the left, moving to the midpoint, to the right, and then moving to the midpoint again.
	10. Finish slalom
	11. Exit course
			

# Autonomous Navigation
	1. Locate Red and Green Buoys
# Here the boat will scan and look for the 4 gate buoys 
# Once located and identified, update map and localize base in space
# Here it will know where the buoys are in space
	2. Set waypoints
# The boat will set a waypoint at the midpoints of the two sets of buoys
# Set a waypoint every ten feet towards the second set of buoys
	3. Move Forward
# Here the boat travels toward the waypoints
# Once it is past the second set it will wait for the Gps coordinates of the first challenge
		

# Find the Path
	1. Circle environment and map out the buoys
# Here the boat will locate the central can buoy using the lidar and camera
# Once the can buoy is located and identified the boat will scan the perimeter of the challenge and save a map of the course
	2. Find a good path toward the center of the environment
# When the perimeter scan is finished, the boat will drop a waypoint in the center of the mess of buoys
	3. get to the center without touching any other buoys
# The boat travels to the waypoint in the mess of buoys while avoiding obstacles
	4. Once in the center find the central can buoy
# Locate can buoy using laser and camera
# Update map with central can location
	5. Locate and circle around the can buoy
	6. Exit out of the environment
# Follow entrance path to exit the mess of buoys
	7. Exit course
			

# Docking
	1. Enter gate buoys
# Here the boat will go to the designated GPS coordinate for the docking challenge. 
	2. Locate dock 
# Here the boat will scan for the dock and recognize it as such
	3. Move X distance from dock
# Here the boat will follow the line perpendicular to the midpoint of the dock 
	4. Orent perpendicular to dock
# Here the boat will orient 
5. Find edge of dock
6. Travel parallel to edge of dock plus X distance further
7. Turn around (yaw)
8. Deploy hydrophones (if not already done)
9. Full speed forward for X seconds
10. Kill thrusters
11. Active hydrophones
12. Listen and map out strongest signal distance
13. Raise hydrophones
14. Orient perpendicular to dock
15. Move to calculated docking (sway)
16. Locate number
17. Align Straight with symbol
18. Pause for X seconds
19. Reverse out of dock
20. Exit course
