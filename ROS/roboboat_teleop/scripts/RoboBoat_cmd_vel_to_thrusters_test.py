# RoboBoat_thrust.py
#
# Mapping ROS cmd_vel messages to thruster inputs for the RoboBoat 2019 
# X-configuration of BlueRobotics T-200 thrusters.
#
# The script is set up to control the ESC that is connected to a 
# Adafruit 16-channel PWM hat on a Raspberry Pi. This requires installation of 
# the libraries to communicate with that board.
#
# You should hear three beeps once the ESC is powered on. Then, two more once
# this script initializes it. Then, this script will cycle through forward and 
# reverse throttle.
